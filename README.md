# Yelper
Yelper is an android application that fetches all restaurants around a user and marks them on Google Maps. Additional information about that location will be shown if the user clicks on a marker

I have tested the application on an LG device running Android 5.1 (API level 22), it works without any crashes. GPS location provider should be enabled.
